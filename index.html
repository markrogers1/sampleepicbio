            <div class="bio">
                <p>Beau Miles, born on December 21, 1979, in Australia, is a redheaded adventurer whose life reads like a series of audacious footnotes in the book of human curiosity. Growing up in the swamps and marshes of Victoria, young Beau spent his childhood hunting lost golf balls, half-hoping to stumble upon something more macabre—like a forgotten body part amid the muck. This early fascination with the odd and overlooked set the tone for a life spent probing the edges of the ordinary, cloaked in sunscreen and big hats to shield his fair skin from the relentless Aussie sun.</p>

                <p>By 1999, Beau enrolled at Monash University in Melbourne, earning a Bachelor of Education and Bachelor of Sport and Outdoor Recreation with a minor in Geography. He dove headfirst into the world of outdoor education, later becoming a lecturer at Monash while pursuing his PhD in expeditionary learning. His 2018 thesis, "The Secret Life of the Sea Kayaker," was no dry academic tome—it chronicled his own grueling adventures, including a 2,000-kilometer paddle around the southern tip of Africa. This blend of scholarship and sweat defined his early career, where he balanced teaching with epic feats like running 650 kilometers across the Australian Alps in just 13 days.</p>

                <p>In 2016, Beau launched his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/beaumiles" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> as part of his PhD project, debuting with the six-part "Bass by Kayak" series—a raw account of kayaking Australia's Bass Strait. What started as an academic experiment exploded into a full-time pursuit. By 2021, he quit lecturing to become a dedicated dad and YouTuber, channeling his energy into homespun challenges that turn the mundane into magic. His breakout film, "A Mile an Hour," captured him running a marathon over 24 hours—one mile every hour—while tackling backyard chores between laps. It racked up millions of views, showcasing his knack for infusing everyday life with profound whimsy.</p>

                <p>Beau's adventures often pay homage to his Gippsland roots, like spending a night in a towering Strzelecki gum tree to highlight endangered species, or secretly building his wife Helen a $60 cabin from scavenged junk. He's a self-proclaimed "poly-jobist"—filmmaker, speaker, writer, and maker of things from other people's trash. His 2021 book, <a href="https://beaumiles.com/" target="_blank">The Backyard Adventurer</a>, distills this philosophy, urging readers to find thrill in the familiar. As a father to two daughters with Helen, Beau weaves family into his narratives, from planting forests to urban foraging in a suit.</p>

                <p>Today, with over 774,000 subscribers and 74 million views, Beau continues to explore thresholds big and small—whether pushing a wheelbarrow in a race (he's the fittest in his district) or eating only beans for 40 days. Support his offbeat quests on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/beaumiles" target="_blank">Patreon</a>, catch glimpses on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beauisms/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, or connect via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beaumilesfilm/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. Beau Miles isn't just adventuring; he's reminding us that the world's wonders hide in our backyards, waiting for a curious soul to uncover them.</p>
